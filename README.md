##  Dataset
Dataset used: Titanic Dataset  
Features include:
- Age
- Gender
- Passenger Class
- Fare
- Family members
- Embarked location

---

##  Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning
2. Handling Missing Values
3. Feature Encoding
4. Feature Scaling
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation

---

##  Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

---

##  Results
Logistic Regression performed better than Decision Tree on this dataset.

---

##  Key Learning
This project highlights that proper data preprocessing is often more important than model complexity.
